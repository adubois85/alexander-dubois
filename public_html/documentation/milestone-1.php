	</head>
	<body>
		<p>
			<strong>Purpose:</strong> This website will serve as a personal portfolio of my work.  I will use it to
			display relevant professional information about myself as well as links to my code bases and completed
			projects that I have worked on.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Audience:</strong> The primary group of people I will be building my personal webpage towards are
			developers and engineers who hire for their companies.  The page will serve as an at-a-glance example of my
			techinical abilities, with links to futher projects should their first impressions prove favorable.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Goal:</strong> The primary goal of this page will be to serve as a launchpad for paid work
			opportunities, ideally full-time with a company that I am interested in.  Aside from that, it will also
			serve as a example of my work for any employers looking for potential freelancers.

		<h1>Persona</h1>
			<p>
				Eric Smith is a 34 year-old software engineer at a mid-sized company that is looking for new talent.
				Aside from his usual design and coding duties, he is also in charge of hiring for his team.
			</p>

			<p>
				While he does most of his core work and typically researches applicants from his windows 10 enterprise
				computer at his office,	he will sometimes examine the applications from his home iMac to spend more time
				investigating them; as he can be quite busy with his other tasks, he likes to give a more thorough
				examination when he is able (which isn't all of the time).  When he isn't at one of his desktops, he always
				has his Google Pixel at his side and ready to get things done.
			</p>

			<p>
				Eric's primary goal with this and all other portfolio websites he visits for potential new hires is both
				to get to know a little about the person before they meet during an interview and to examine the quality
				of their work to determine if they are even worth interviewing.
			</p>

		<h1>Use Case</h1>
			<p>
				After receiving a number of applications for a position that was recently posted, Eric must narrow down the
				field a little.  He initially scans through the resumés and separates them into two piles: qualified and
				unqualified.  From there, he takes a closer look at the qualified applicants and flags any that stand out
				.  Among them is my resumé.
			</p>
				Even with his initial preparation, he still has double-digit applicants that seem qualified for the job,
				and time is still at a premium.  He has asked each of the applicants that didn't alredy include a
				portofolio with their resumé to e-mail it to him.  In the meantime, he wants to	be able to look at each
				applicants' portfolio that he does currently have access to and quickly assess whether they seem worth
				bringing in for an interview or if it would be a waste of everyone's time.
