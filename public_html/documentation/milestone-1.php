			<strong>Purpose:</strong> This website will serve as a personal portfolio of my work.  I will use it to
			display relevant professional information about myself as well as links to my code bases and completed
			projects that I have worked on.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Audience:</strong> The primary group of people I will be building my personal webpage towards are
			developers and engineers who hire for their companies.  The page will serve as an at-a-glance example of my
			techinical abilities, with links to futher projects should their first impressions prove favorable.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Goal:</strong> The primary goal of this page will be to serve as a launchpad for paid work
			opportunities, ideally full-time with a company that I am interested in.  Aside from that, it will also
			serve as a example of my work for any employers looking for potential freelancers.
