	</head>
	<body>
		<p>
			<strong>Purpose:</strong> This website will serve as a personal portfolio of my work.  I will use it to
			display relevant professional information about myself as well as links to my code bases and completed
			projects that I have worked on.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Audience:</strong> The primary group of people I will be building my personal webpage towards are
			developers and engineers who hire for their companies.  The page will serve as an at-a-glance example of my
			techinical abilities, with links to futher projects should their first impressions prove favorable.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Goal:</strong> The primary goal of this page will be to serve as a launchpad for paid work
			opportunities, ideally full-time with a company that I am interested in.  Aside from that, it will also
			serve as a example of my work for any employers looking for potential freelancers.
		</p>

		<h1>Persona</h1>
			<p>
				Eric Smith is a 34 year-old software engineer at a mid-sized company that is looking for new talent.
				Aside from his usual design and coding duties, he is also in charge of hiring for his team.
			</p>

			<p>
				After receiving a number of applications for a position that was recently posted, he must narrow down the
				field a little.  He initially scans through the resumés and separates them into two piles: qualified and
				unqualified.  From there, he takes a closer look at the qualified applicants and flags any that stand out
				.  Among them is my resumé.
			</p>

			<p>
				While he usually will research applicants from his windows 10 enterprise computer at work, he will
				sometimes examine the applications from his home iMac to spend more time investigating them; as he can be
				quite busy with his other work, he likes to give a more thorough examination when he is able (which isn't
				all the time).When he isn't at one of his desktops, he always has his Google Pixel at his side and ready
				to get tasks done.
			</p>

			<p>
				Even with his initial preparation, he still has double-digit applicants that seem qualified for the job,
				and time is still at a premium.  He wants to be able to look at each applicants' portfolio and
				quickly assess whether they seem worth bringing in for an interview or if it would be a waste of
				everyone's time.
