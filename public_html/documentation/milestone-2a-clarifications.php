			So, how I had originally envisioned the website was that the page would open on a small welcome message with the clickable arrows around it.  Clicking on each would slide that section into view from the opposite side of the arrow.

				Regarding the difference between the mobile and desktop versions, it was during wireframming that it became apparent how much more empty space there would be in the desktop design.  Since I think it would look unsightly to try and actually use all that space (key word try--it would still largely be empty, just inside of a giant frame covering most of the browser window), I decided that I would be better served having a more proportionate frame to contain each section slide into view.  Also, due to how much more quickly a phone or other small device's screen can become visually cluttered, I figured it would make more sense to have the frames be opaque.  In contrast, a desktop browser has much more breathing room, so having some relatively small and superfluous visual flairs (e.g. a semi-transparent frame for the different sections) can add a bit of aesthetic interest without significantly detracting from the experience.
