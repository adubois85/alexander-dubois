			So, how I had originally envisioned the website was that the page would open on a small welcome message with the clickable arrows around it.  Clicking on each would slide that section into view from the opposite side of the arrow.

				Regarding the difference between the mobile and desktop versions, it was during wireframming that it became apparent how much more empty space there would be in the desktop design.  Since I think it would look unsightly to try and actually use all that space (key word try--it would still largely be empty, just inside of a giant frame covering most of the browser window), I decided that I would be better served having a more proportionate frame to contain each section slide into view.  Also, due to how much more quickly a phone or other small device's screen can become visually cluttered, I figured it would make more sense to have the frames be opaque.  In contrast, a desktop browser has much more breathing room, so having some relatively small and superfluous visual flairs (e.g. a semi-transparent frame for the different sections) can add a bit of aesthetic interest without significantly detracting from the experience.

				Regarding how a user would back out of a slide in frame to the landing screen, my initial thought was that clicking on the arrow that moves to the side of the screen to make way for the frame sliding in (and labels it) would slide the frame back out.  As an example, clicking on the bottom arrow (I believe I put that as the contact form) would cause it to slide to the top of the screen with the frame containing the contact form following.  When the user is finished, they would click the arrow to slide it and the frame back down and to their original positions (the arrow forming a ring with the other arrows and the frame off the screen).  I realize that this setup may not be immediately intuitive for some or most users, so another option I had thought of was simply to tap anywhere on the frame to dismiss it; I don't particularly like this one, though, as especially on a mobile device, it would be easy to accidentally close a frame.  The other thought I had was simply to put an X somewhere on the frame to close it, but I feel that would detract from the overall aesthetic--it would easily be the clunkiest solution.  I'm open to other suggestions you may have if you feel the original idea with the arrows is too obtuse.
