		<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
		<p>
			This will be a personal portfolio website.  The site will be broken up into four main sections and accessed
			through a central hub.  Clicking on one of the arrows will move that arrow to the side of the screen and
			cause a frame to slide in from the other side with the relevant content.  The four sections will be a
			bio--information about myself as well as links to my github and social media accounts, a resumeé--my current
			resumé, projects--a showcase of projects I am or have worked on, and contact--a secure contact submission form.
		</p>
