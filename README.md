## Milestone 1 feedback

Your directory structure, gitignore and code look great! You get a green stamp of approval from [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?acceptlanguage=&doc=https%3A%2F%2Fbootcamp-coders.cnm.edu%2F~adubois2%2Falexander-dubois%2Fpublic_html%2Fdocumentation%2Fmilestone-1.php), which is always good to check before pushing code to production.

Your descriptions for use case, persona and goals are thorough and specific, which will help tremendously when it comes time to create your wireframes.

Something to be aware of going forward is your use of the `<strong>` tags. This is typically only used for semantic purposes, and not styling purposes. Going forward it's typically better to use a `<span>` tag with a class or id to style text. Of course, if you want to draw attention to text specifically to get a point across to someone using a screen reader or just viewing your site, the `<strong>` tag is perfectly fine.

You've done a great job on milestone 1, and pass with a [tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/)! You're clear to begin working on [milestone 2a](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/).
