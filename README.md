## Milestone 1 feedback

Your directory structure, gitignore and code look great! You get a green stamp of approval from [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?acceptlanguage=&doc=https%3A%2F%2Fbootcamp-coders.cnm.edu%2F~adubois2%2Falexander-dubois%2Fpublic_html%2Fdocumentation%2Fmilestone-1.php), which is always good to check before pushing code to production.

Your descriptions for use case, persona and goals are thorough and specific, which will help tremendously when it comes time to create your wireframes.

Something to be aware of going forward is your use of the `<strong>` tags. This is typically only used for semantic purposes, and not styling purposes. Going forward it's typically better to use a `<span>` tag with a class or id to style text. Of course, if you want to draw attention to text specifically to get a point across to someone using a screen reader or just viewing your site, the `<strong>` tag is perfectly fine.

You've done a great job on milestone 1, and pass with a [tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/)! You're clear to begin working on [milestone 2a](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/).

## Milestone 2a feedback

Your directory structure continues to look great, and your HTML has passed the W3 Validator again. Great job!

Your description helped clarify that you'll be putting all your content on one page. That wasn't immediately apparent from your wireframes, but to be fair I read your description after looking at the wireframes. I noticed that your mobile wireframes don't include overlaying the content on your clickable buttons, but your desktop wireframes include the overlay. Is this how you want the final product to behave? That's great if that's how you want it to behave, but you never specifically stated either way. Also, how is the end user going to get back to the original menu?

I really like your idea for PWP, and I can't wait for this to take shape. You pass with a [tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). **However** I would like you to clarify both questions above before moving on to [milestone 2b](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/). Let me know if you have any questions.
